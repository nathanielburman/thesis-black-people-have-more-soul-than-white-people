# thesis-black-people-have-more-soul-than-white-people
I really think this has some very significant meaning now in the revelation of simulation theory and AI theory.

I am begining to take notice that certain white people seem to repeat data and information as if they have less soul than Blacks. When Blacks describe something, they do so with soul, not more emotion. It is their soul that we see and feel. It maybe that White people are making a drastic mistake in thinking that they need to be more emotional to be more like Blacks, who have more soul.
